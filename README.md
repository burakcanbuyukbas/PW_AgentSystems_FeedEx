# PW_AgentSystems_FeedEx
A multi-agent project to manage surplus food problem.


TODO:

1. Map markers does not work -- see map.html and GoogleMapsScene.java
2. After matchings, routes should be drawn on map. Functions added but not tested. -- see map.html and GoogleMapsScene.java
3. There needs to be some wait() after agent actions for a better presentation. After that waits markers should be moved where they should be.
